# PairedReadGenomeReconstructor

# Description

PairedReadGenomeReconstructor is a Python script that reconstructs a genome string from paired k-mer reads with a fixed distance d. The algorithm builds a Paired de Bruijn graph, finds an Eulerian path, and reconstructs the genome based on the path. This approach is commonly used in bioinformatics, particularly in genome assembly using paired-end reads.

# Functionality
* PairedDeBruijnGraph(k, d, paired_reads)
* Purpose: Builds a directed graph from paired k-mer reads with a specified gap d.
# Parameters:
* k (int): Length of each k-mer.
* d (int): Distance between the two k-mers in a pair.
* paired_reads (list): A list of tuples, each containing a pair of k-mers.
# Returns:
* graph (dict): A directed graph represented as an adjacency list, where nodes are pairs of prefix and suffix strings.
  
# EulerianPath(graph)
* Purpose: Finds an Eulerian path in the graph.
# Parameters:
* graph (dict): A directed graph from the paired k-mers.
# Returns:
* path (list): A list of nodes representing the Eulerian path.
* PathToGenome(path, k, d)

# Purpose:
* Reconstructs the genome string from the Eulerian path.

# Parameters:
* path (list): Eulerian path obtained from the graph.
* k (int): Length of each k-mer.
* d (int): Gap between paired k-mers.

# Returns:
* genome (str): Reconstructed genome string.
* StringReconstructionFromReadPairs(k, d, paired_reads)
* Purpose: Full pipeline to reconstruct the genome string from paired reads.
# Parameters:
* k (int), d (int), paired_reads (list): As described above.
# Returns:
* text (str): Reconstructed genome string from paired reads.


# Example Usage

```
# Input data
k = 3
d = 1
paired_reads = [
    ("ACC", "ATA"), ("ACT", "ATT"), ("ATA", "TGA"), ("ATT", "TGA"),
    ("CAC", "GAT"), ("CCG", "TAC"), ("CGA", "ACT"), ("CTG", "AGC"),
    ("CTG", "TTC"), ("GAA", "CTT"), ("GAT", "CTG"), ("GAT", "CTG"),
    ("TAC", "GAT"), ("TCT", "AAG"), ("TGA", "GCT"), ("TGA", "TCT"),
    ("TTC", "GAA")
]

# Reconstruction
result = StringReconstructionFromReadPairs(k, d, paired_reads)
```

# Output
AATT
